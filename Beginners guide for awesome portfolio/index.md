<p  align= "centre">Lets do this 💪🏻</p>

✏ Login to your GitHub account

✏ Clone the repository.

✏ Create a folder where you want to store the project on your desktop and clone the new repository


~ $ git clone https://github.com/smaranjitghose/awesome-portfolio-websites.git

✏ Now you can make change in the templates by opening in your favourite text editor.

✏ After making changes in your repo now you have to push it

✏ Add commit and push all your changes

~ $ git add --all

~ $ git commit -m "Initial commit"

~ $ git push -u origin master


And you are good to go 😎🎉🎉


If you are deploying Github pages for the first time, you might need to wait for a while before you see the actual site. It is not advisable to make changes directly on the portfolio. You can edit files directly on GitHub in any of your repositories using the file editor.
